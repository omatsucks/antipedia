                (not to be confused with the 2012 series <u>arthmatic</u>) This is a branch of psychological philosophy, Arithmetic is usualy a broad term, it can be used to refer to the dog type <u>Arithmetic</u>, the pain in the lower portion of the <u>frontal lobe</u>, and many more terms.
                <br>
                Usualy in <u>psychology</u>, The brain of the human body is studied, but Arithmetic is an exception as it studies the rest of the neural network of the body, Aswell as the emotional effects of prolonged radiation,
                The most common elements studied in this field is <u>Uranium</u> (uranium-238 is the most common by far) and <u>Thorium</u>, <u>Dogs</u> are the most safe animal to use when using such dangerous metals.

                we can enter the weight of the dog as <u>Gamma  </u>, and the height of the dog as <u>Alpha</u>, And the <u>atomical weight</u> of the element as <u>Beta</u>, we get the numerical <u>percentage</u> of the psychological effects when the dog has prolonged exposure to the element,
                now this information can be helpful because if we multiply the output by <u>Pi</u>, we get the ratio between the exposure to dogs and the exposure to humans (de:dh)
